    This an example function to train a baseline.

    NBï¼š This baaseline only works for IEEE14 bus environment. For other environments, the agent should be modified accordingly.

    In order to be valid, if you chose (which is recommended) to provide a training script to help other retrain your
    baseline in different environments, or for longer period of time etc. This script should be contain the "train"
    function with at least the following arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    env: :class:`grid2op.Environment.Environment`
        The environmnent on which the baseline will be trained

    name: ``str``
        Fancy name you give to this baseline.

    iterations: ``int``
        Number of training iterations to perform

    save_path: ``str``
        The path where the baseline will be saved at the end of the training procedure.

    load_path: ``str``
        Path where to look for reloading the model. Use ``None`` if no model should be loaded.

    kwargs:
        Other key-word arguments that you might use for training.
