    This function is a helper to train more easily some agent using their default "train" method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent: :class:`grid2op.Agent`
        A grid2op agent that must implement all the baseline attributes and the train method.

    env: :class:`grid2op.Environment`
        The environment on which to train your baseline. It must be compatible with the agent created.

    name: ``str``
        Here for compatibility with the baseline "train" method. Currently unused (define the name when you create
        your baseline)

    iterations: ``int``
        Number of iterations on which to train your agent.

    save_path: ``str``
        Where to save your results (put None do deactivate saving)

    load_path: ``str``
        Path to load the agent from.

    kwargs_train: ``dict``
        Other argument that will be passed to `agent.train(...)`

    Returns
    -------
    agent: :class:`grid2op.Agent`
        The trained agent.
